## Z Flip Launcher

#### Current limitations:

- Currently requires Screen lock type to be set to None in Settings -> Lock screen

- Keyboards will not open on the cover screen and some app functionality is limited

- Switching apps requires tapping power to close the widget and launching the widget again (turn on cover, swipe to widget). The app list, however, can be swiped closed.

-  ~~Apps launched from the cover will not launch from the launcher app drawer when opening the phone. This can be resolved in two ways:~~
     
     - ~~Tap the power button to turn off the screen before opening the phone. This will launch a new instance of the app when opening the phone that will function normally.~~

    - ~~Launch or close any apps used on the cover from the "Recents" navigation button. This will restore the app or allow it to launch normally next time.~~

- Samsung Health must be uninstalled to free up the package name for the whitelisted widgets. Installing this app will then add it as one of the options in the cover screen widgets.
