## SamSprung Launcher

#### Current limitations:

- Apps require Screen lock type set to None / Swipe in Settings -> Lock screen
     - Bixby unlock can be used as a workaround for other lock types

- Keyboards will not open on the cover screen and some app functionality is limited
     - Firmware limitation by Samsung - Secondary IME support is disabled

- Switching apps requires tapping power and waiting for at least two seconds to close the app before launching the widget again (turn on cover, swipe to widget). The app list, however, can be swiped closed.

- Samsung Health must be uninstalled to free up the package name for the whitelisted widgets. Installing this app will then add it as an option in the cover screen widgets.
     - Firmware limitation by Samsung - Widget package name or signature
